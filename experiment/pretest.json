        "a": "Long Range Wide Area Network",
        "b": "Low Resistance Wireless Area Network",
        "c": "Local Radio Wireless Area Network",
        "d": "Logical Range Wide Application Network"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. LoRaWAN stands for Long Range Wide Area Network. <a href='https://lora-alliance.org/about-lorawan/'>Learn more</a>",
        "b": "Incorrect. This is not the correct expansion.",
        "c": "Incorrect. LoRaWAN is not limited to local radio.",

        "d": "FM radio bands"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. LoRaWAN uses unlicensed ISM bands like 868 MHz (EU) or 915 MHz (US). <a href='https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/lorawan/frequencies-by-country/'>See details</a>",
        "b": "Incorrect. Licensed 5G bands are used for cellular networks.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Satellite bands are not standard for LoRaWAN.",
