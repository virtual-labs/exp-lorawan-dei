## Procedure

1. Open the experiment in the virtual lab for creating an IoT application using LoRaWAN and ESP8266/ESP32.  
   The LoRaWAN virtual device and dashboard interface are already available in the workspace.

2. Observe the device setup.  
   Check the LoRaWAN device panel showing device ID, activation status, and basic parameters.  
   Note that the dashboard contains charts to display incoming LoRaWAN data.

3. Activate the LoRaWAN device.  
   Click the "Activate Device" or similar button provided in the interface.  
   The device will initiate a virtual join request to the LoRaWAN network (simulated).

4. Start the simulation.  
   After activation, click the "Start Simulation" button.  
   The virtual device will begin sending simulated sensor data packets through the LoRaWAN protocol.

5. Monitor the dashboard.  
   Observe the live data values displayed on the charts and data widgets below the simulation.  
   Check how each new LoRaWAN packet updates the dashboard with fresh sensor readings.

6. Interact with the interface if required.  
   Some dashboards may allow switching between charts, viewing packet logs, or changing update speeds.

7. Record observations.  
   Note how frequently the device sends data, how values change over time, and how the charts visualize LoRaWAN communication.

8. Stop the simulation.  
   Click the "Stop Simulation" button after completing the observations.
